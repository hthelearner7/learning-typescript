## What I Learned from the Practical TypeScript Course

Through the **Practical TypeScript Course**, I gained a complete understanding of TypeScript â€” starting from the fundamentals and progressing to advanced concepts â€” by building multiple hands-on projects and real-world examples.

### ðŸ”¹ Core TypeScript Concepts

I learned how to:

-   Set up TypeScript projects efficiently using **Vite**.
-   Use **type annotations** and understand **type inference** to write safer, more maintainable code.
-   Work with **union types**, and handle special types such as `any`, `unknown`, and `never`.
-   Implement and manipulate **arrays**, **objects**, and complex data structures.
-   Write and manage **functions** in TypeScript with strong type safety.

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced TypeScript Skills

I explored advanced topics like:

-   Implementing **generics** for flexible and reusable components.
-   **Fetching and validating data** using TypeScript and the **Zod** library.
-   Understanding **TypeScript declaration files** and applying **class-based programming** concepts.
-   Writing clean, scalable code using TypeScriptâ€™s strong typing system.

### ðŸ”¹ TypeScript with React

I integrated TypeScript into React applications, learning how to:

-   Properly type **props**, **state**, and **event handlers**.
-   Work with **React Context API** and **reducers** in a strongly-typed environment.
-   Manage **global state** and handle **data fetching** with TypeScript.
-   Build complex component structures with strict type safety.
-   Utilize **localStorage** and manage task states in a real-world task management app.

### ðŸ”¹ Final Project

As a culmination of the course, I built a **modern store application** using:

-   **React + TypeScript**
-   **Shadcn/UI** for a clean, modern design system
-   **React Router** for navigation
-   **Authentication** and **pagination** features for a complete full-stack experience
